This is a backend server purely for hosting [nickel](https://github.com/lzell/nickel). In the long term, we will remove this part as long as one of the following three methods work:

1. Port nickel to JavaScript
2. Use [opal](http://opalrb.org/) to compile nickel into JavaScript
3. Use [mruby-browser](https://github.com/xxuejie/mruby-browser) to run nickel in the browser.
