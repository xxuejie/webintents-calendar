This is a web intent service for editing calendars. It is built for CSE 791 Social Media Mining course.

The project contains two parts: a Chrome extension parses the Twitter/Facebook page and let users create calendar event right in the current Page; a backend part provides the intent service, and connect to Google Calendar for storing the event.

The icons used in this project are taken from [here](http://ux.etao.com/fonts). Thanks to the etao UX team for creating these nice icons.
