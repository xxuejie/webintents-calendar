This is a web intent service for editing calendars. It is built for CSE 791 Social Media Mining course.

The project contains two parts: a Chrome extension parses the Twitter/Facebook page and let users create calendar event right in the current Page; a backend part provides the intent service, and connect to Google Calendar for storing the event.
